YDKJS scope & closure

Chapter 1
The scope is a set of rules for storing variables in some location, and for finding those variables at a later time.
Compilation can be divided in Tokenizing, Parsing and Code generation.
There are three main characters in the process of compilation: Engine, Compiler and Scope.
Two distinct actions are taken for a variable assignment: First, Compiler declares a variable (if not previously declared in the current scope), and second, when executing, Engine looks up the variable in Scope and assigns to it, if found.
RHS looks for the source of a specific variable. LHS assigns a value to a variable.
